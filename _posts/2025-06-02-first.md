After a lot of caffiene... I have been slowly creating this site. I used [the official setup guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) in order to begin its structure. I'm still learning how to use Jekyll's system, but I like it so far.

Eventually, I plan to have a domain name for this site, but right now it is under Github.
